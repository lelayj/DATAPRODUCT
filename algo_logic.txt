This is the algorithm logic relative to the code shown under the tab  
STATISTICS/statistics code, 
which can be found on GitHUb at the link
https://github.com/lelayj/DATAPRODUCT as well.    

Here is the way the code is built:  

Tests were carried out on each of the 7 time series proposed in the first select box
of the tab PLAY.

note:
period used to forecast = training set
period to forecast = test set

For each time series:

We consider any possible pair (training set, test set) of two consecutive intervals
that can be extracted from the time series with a minimum length of pMin for the 
training set and a test set length equal to about one quarter the training set length. 

The values taken for pMin are: 20 for ausbeer, chocolate confectionery and UKgas,
15 for austres and JohnsonJohnson, and 8 for retail turnover and reports of a French
company, depending on their length: 211, 149, 108, 89, 84, 39 and 24, respectively.

Given a pair, the MAPE (MEAN ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE ERROR) of each forecasting method is
calculated, allowing to rank the methods according to their MAPE, starting from
the best one. So, a ranking relative to this pair is obtained. 

Now, given a time series, we focus for each forecasting method on the number 
of times when the method ranks nÂ°1 and retain this number as a percentage
of the number of rankings, and focus on the mean and standard deviation 
of its MAPE as well
